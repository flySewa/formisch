# Installation

Below you will learn how to add Formisch to your project.

## TypeScript

If you are using TypeScript, we recommend that you enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json` so that all types are calculated correctly.

> The minimum required TypeScript version is v5.0.2.

```ts
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Install Valibot

Formisch uses [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) for schema-based validation. You need to install it first because it is a peer dependency.

```bash
npm install valibot     # npm
yarn add valibot        # yarn
pnpm add valibot        # pnpm
bun add valibot         # bun
deno add npm:valibot    # deno
```

## Install Formisch

You can add Formisch to your project with a single command using your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm install @formisch/svelte     # npm
yarn add @formisch/svelte        # yarn
pnpm add @formisch/svelte        # pnpm
bun add @formisch/svelte         # bun
deno add npm:@formisch/svelte    # deno
```

Then you can import it into any JavaScript or TypeScript file.

```ts
import { … } from '@formisch/svelte';
```

## For AI Agents

Formisch includes an agent skill that teaches AI agents the correct patterns for working with Formisch forms. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx skills add open-circle/agent-skills
npx add-skill open-circle/agent-skills
```
